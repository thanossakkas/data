ITHAKI
(I have used the greek written form of Ulysse’s island:
Ithaki (I’thaki) –note that the accent is on the second syllable.)
When you set out on the way to Ithaki
wish for a long, eventful journey,
full of adventure, full of understanding.
Of Laistrygonians and Cyclops,
the raging Poseidon, never be afraid.
You’ll never find such things on your way
if all your thoughts remain noble, and if your spirit
and body are touched by worthy emotion.
The Laistrygonians and Cyclops,
the fierce Poseidon, will never be encountered
if they’re not carried in your soul, and if your soul
does not erect them on your path, before you.

Wish for a long, eventful journey.
Many the summer mornings when you enter
- in high spirits, joyful expectation -
harbours first seen; in Phoenician emporiums
you’ll stop to acquire good merchandise,
mother-of-pearl and coral, ebony and amber,
and every kind you find of heady perfumes,
as many as you can get sensuous perfumes.
In Egypt, you must visit many cities
to learn all you can gather from their scholars.

Always keep Ithaki in your mind.
Arriving there is your destination.
But do not make haste, prolong your journey.
Better it lasts for many a long year
so that, when old, you’ll anchor at the island
rich with all you’ve gained on the way,
expecting no more riches from Ithaki.

Ithaki gave you the joyful journey.
Without her you would not be on the way.
There’s nothing else that she can give you now.

And if you find Ithaki poor, still she has not deceived you.
With such amassed experience and wisdom,
you’ll know by now the meaning of Ithakis.
